# Snail Species Recognition Application

This project aims to develop an application for recognizing snail species based on image analysis. The application allows users to upload images, process them, and obtain species recognition results. The project utilizes Python, Keras, TensorFlow, and Flask for the implementation.

## Features

- Image uploading: Users can upload images of snails for species recognition.
- Image processing: The application processes the uploaded images to enhance and prepare them for species recognition.
- Species recognition: The application employs machine learning techniques implemented with Keras and TensorFlow to recognize the species of snails in the uploaded images.
- User-friendly interface: The frontend app is created using Flask, providing an intuitive and interactive user interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Flask


## Custom Models and Advanced Usage

For advanced users and machine learning enthusiasts, this project also provides a Jupyter Notebook file (`snail-species-recognition.ipynb`) where you can explore and create your own custom models, experiment with different algorithms, and further enhance the snail species recognition capabilities. Feel free to modify the notebook according to your requirements and contribute your insights back to the project.
